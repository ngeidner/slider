The Cost of Being a Woman

<div style="font-family:arial;font-size:100%;"> I am playing around with the idea of using Juxtapose.JS from the Knight Lab as a simple, interactive graphic form. I created this page as a proof of concept before creating an assignment for students in my data journalism course. It use 2013 income data from the U.S. Census. I am still not sure Juxtapose is a good way to do this, but I think there could be something to the act revealing information that could be beneficial for the user.</div>

<div class="juxtapose" data-startingposition="50" data-showlabels="true" data-showcredits="true" data-animate="true" data-mode="horizontal">
